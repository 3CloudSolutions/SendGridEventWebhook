This code is not production ready. It is meant to help you integrate quickly with SendGrid when developing for ASP.NET/Microsoft Azure. You will need to incorporate error handling and testing. 

The companion blog post, which explains the usage of this code can be found [here](http://sendgrid.com/blog/tracking-email-using-azure-sendgrid-event-webhook-part-1).
